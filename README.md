### What Are Facial Landmarks?

Facial landmarks are predefined anatomical points on the face that can be automatically detected by machine learning algorithms. These points are typically distributed across key facial regions, such as the eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and face contour.

### Common Applications

- **Eye and Facial Expression Tracking**: Used to detect where a person is looking or to recognize their emotions:

- **Facial Animation**: Realistic animations of characters in movies and games often use landmarks to capture human facial movements.
- **Augmented Reality**: Overlaying filters or visual effects on detected faces in real-time.
- **Facial Recognition**: Landmarks are used as distinguishing features to identify individuals.
